## [3.2.0] - 2026-01-25

This release introduces two new card styles, header icons, and fixes the "Starting..." display issue.

### Features

- **New Card Styles**: Added two new compact card layouts:
  - **Eventy Style** (`style: eventy`): Compact horizontal view with icon, title/subtitle, and prominent countdown unit display
  - **Classic Compact Style** (`style: classic-compact`): Compact horizontal layout combining icon, title/subtitle, and progress circle
- **Header Icons**: Added icon support for all card styles with customizable colors and backgrounds
  - `header_icon`: Icon to display (e.g., `mdi:cake-variant`)
  - `header_icon_color`: Icon color
  - `header_icon_background`: Icon background color

### Fixed

- **"Starting..." Display Issue** ([#33](https://github.com/Rishi8078/TimeFlow-Card/issues/33)): Card now auto-falls back to the highest available time unit instead of showing "Starting..." when the countdown begins
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed redundant custom element registration in ErrorDisplay component

### Changed

- **Improved Time Unit Display**: Better handling of time unit visibility with automatic fallback to the next available unit
- **Localized Time Units**: Eventy-style labels are now fully localized (DAYS → DÍAS, JOURS, TAGE, etc.)

### Notes

- **Breaking Changes**: None
- **New Dependencies**: None
- **Compatibility**: Works with all existing configurations

## [3.1.2] - 2026-01-17

- **Calendar Month Logic**: Implemented iterative calendar month calculation that accounts for varying month lengths (28-31 days)
- **Timezone Bug Fix**: Fixed visual editor timezone conversion that was shifting times when saving dates
- **DST-Aware Calculations**: Month calculations now properly handle daylight saving time transitions

### Changed

- **Countdown Accuracy**: All countdown displays now show precise, intuitive time remaining
- **Month Calculation Method**: Uses actual calendar months instead of fixed averages for better user experience

### Notes

- **Breaking Changes**: None
- **Performance**: Improved calculation accuracy without performance impact
- **Compatibility**: Fixes apply to all existing countdown configurations

## [3.1.1] - 2026-01-14

This release brings theme integration and localization support to enhance the user experience.

### Features

- **Localization Support**: Added localized strings for countdown states (starting/completed) across supported languages (EN, FR, DE, ES, IT, NL)
- **Localized Time Units**: Full and compact time unit labels now render correctly in the user's language
- **Service-Level Localization**: Timer subtitles (Alexa, Google Home, standard HA timers) now use localization for translated status messages

This major release introduces the visual editor and enhanced smart assistant support.

### Features

- **Visual Editor**: Complete UI-based configuration - no more manual YAML editing required
- **Google Nest Support**: Full support for Google timers (active, paused, and finished states)
- **Amazon Alexa Support**: Full support for Alexa timers (active, paused, and finished states)
- **Auto-Discovery**: Seamlessly fetch and display active timers from Alexa and Google on the same card

### Changed

- **Configuration Method**: Visual editor now available as primary configuration method
- **Smart Timer Integration**: Enhanced support for multiple smart assistant platforms

This release focuses on Visual editor

### Breaking change
changed the attribute color to text color to avoid confusion 



## [3.0.3] - 2025-08-17

This release focuses on robust Alexa timer lifecycle handling, auto-discovery improvements, and consistent expired messaging.

### 🔧 Fixed

- **Paused Timers in Auto-Discovery**: Paused Alexa timers are now included in auto-discovery and selectable when no active timers exist.
- **Attribute-Driven Status**: Timer status and label are now derived from rich attributes, ignoring entity.state for reliability.
- **Finished State Robustness**: Finished timers show "<label> timer complete" immediately at finish, even while still listed as active, and remain until removed from active.
- **ID-Based Pinning**: Per-entity cache tracks finished timer IDs to avoid mislabeling when multiple Alexa timers exist.
- **Discovery Filtering**: Only entities with active or paused timers are included in auto-discovery; 
- **Expired Messaging Consistency**: Auto-discovery main display and subtitle now use the same logic as explicit Alexa timers, showing "<label> timer complete" or "Timer complete" as appropriate.


### 📝 Changed

- **Auto-Discovery Selection**: Auto-discovery now prefers active timers, then paused, and falls back to "No timers" if none are available.
- **Subtitle and Main Display**: Both now use TimerEntityService.getTimerSubtitle for expired states, ensuring consistent messaging.
- **UI Reactivity**: Improved card reactivity so expired/finished states update live, avoiding stale "Completed! 🎉" text.

### 🚀 Features

- **Robust Alexa Timer Lifecycle**: Handles active, paused, and finished states with attribute-first logic and ID-based tracking.
- **Consistent Expired Messaging**: "Timer complete" and "<label> timer complete" are shown for finished Alexa timers in all display modes.
- **No Timers Detection**: Card reliably shows "No timers" when no active or paused timers remain, without requiring a manual refresh.

## [3.0.2] - 2025-08-16

This release focuses on fixing issues with Action handing and improving Alexa timers.

### 🔧 Fixed

-   **Improved Alexa Timer Support**: Enhanced the logic for discovering and handling Alexa timers.
-   **Action Handler**: fixed issues with  `tap_action`, `hold_action`, and `double_tap_action` not working as intended.

## [3.0.1] - 2025-08-09

This release focuses on adding new interactive features, improving configuration validation, and making the card more resilient to errors.

### 🚀 Features

-   **Action Handler**: Added support for `tap_action`, `hold_action`, and `double_tap_action` to make the card interactive.
-   **Added Templates to Expired_text**: Added support for templates in Expired_text.
-   **Enhanced Validation**: The configuration validation now provides detailed error messages and suggestions to help you fix issues quickly.
-   **Error Display**: Configuration errors are now displayed gracefully within the card, preventing crashes and making debugging easier.

### 🔧 Fixed

-   **Improved Alexa Timer Support**: Enhanced the logic for discovering and handling Alexa timers to be more reliable.
-   **Default Timer Action**: Timer entities now have a default `tap_action` that opens the "more-info" dialog for convenience.

## [3.0.0] - 2025-07-29

- **Jinja2 Compatibility**: Now properly handles dates from `isoformat()` function
- **Smart Detection**: Uses regex pattern to detect timezone info and preserve it appropriately

### 📝 Changed
